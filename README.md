## Setup and Usage

### Quick Start

1. Set up a python environment using `python -m venv <PATH>\venv`, then activate environment by `venv\Scripts\activate.bat`
1. Install requirements: `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Execute `main.py` by `python main.py`

### Run Scripts

The repository contains the following function to process experimental data:

#### API

* `experiments\api` contains a database wrapper for SQLite written with `SQLAlquemy`
* it can be used to **import** data from `CGP optimization` and analyze them as follows
  * `python api\main.py --importmany "<PATH>\test_api\many_results_dir"`
  * `python api\main.py --importone "<PATH>\test_api\one_result_dir"`
* database is stored (or created if it doesn not exist) in: `<PATH>\api\experiments.db`
* For more details on how to use the database api, see: [api/Readme.md](api/Readme.md)

#### Data Dashboards and Plotting

* `main.py` runs the main analysis and plotting scripts and contains a text-based user menu
* Run it as follows:
  * `python -m main.py`
* Select entries of the following manu by typing the related number:
  * `1 -- Create plots of complexity and fitness for every evias datasets`
  * `2 -- Read DB and create 1 plot with all fitness values`
  * `3 -- Read DB and create one plot for each dataset`
  * `4 -- Generate HTML reports`
  * `5 -- Print Dashboard Plots`
  * `6 -- Print Sample Plots`
  * `7 -- Create ACSOS Plot`
  * `8 -- Follow Up Optimization using SA / LS`
  * `8 -- Plot Missing SA/LS and CGP Evolutions`
  * `10 -- Plot CGP Insights`
  * `0 -- EXIT`

#### Guide to Script Outputs

* `1 -- Create plots of complexity and fitness for every evias datasets`
  * Writes plot to: `report\...`
* `2 -- Read DB and create 1 plot with all fitness values`
* `3 -- Read DB and create one plot for each dataset`
* `4 -- Generate HTML reports`
  * Creates an HTML overview on all results in `api\experiments.db`
  * Writes it to: `report\results.html`
* `5 -- Print Dashboard Plots`
* `6 -- Print Sample Plots`
  * Contains scripts to create sample plots
  * using `matplotlib`
* `7 -- Create ACSOS Plot`
  * Creates fitness plots used for the ACSOS 2023 paper
  * Script is located in: `dashboard\acsos_plots.py`
  * It reads static values from: `dashboard\acsos_vars.py`
  * Writes it to: `scripts\report\*.png`
* `8 -- Follow Up Optimization using SA / LS`
  * Runs follow-up parameter tuning with additional algorithms
  * See section `Follow-Up Optimization`
* `9 -- Plot Missing SA/LS and CGP Evolutions`
  * creates plot of transistor and roadcracks cgp fitness progress
  * computes sa/ls for the same pipelines (transistor and roadcracks)
* `10 -- Plot CGP Insights`
  * Read from `test\cgp_insights` logs for missing_cable and tile_cracks
  * creates dot pipeline charts for generations with a fitness increase
  * writes it to `test\cgp_insights_out`
* `0 -- EXIT`

### Follow Up Optimization using SA / LS
* Further experiments were conducted on selected pipelines generated by CGP
* For that purpose, a pipeline with a fitness closest to the mean fitness for each dataset was selected
* The pipeline was run in MVTec HALCON to evaluate the result
* Two algorithms were then applied to tune the operator parameters, but NOT change the order of operators:
  * Simmulated annealing (SA)
  * Local search (LS)

#### Guide to Script Menu
* The LS/SA algorithm can be run using a sub menu (8 - Follow Up ...) which shows the following menu:
* OR run: 
  * `python -m param_tuning/run_param_tuning.py`
* This will show the following menu:
  * `FOLLOW UP OPTIMIZATION using SA /LS`
  * `1 -- MANUAL 1: Export digraphs to txt`
  * `2 -- MANUAL 2: Read manual HDEV files and perform SA/LS`
  * `3 -- AUTOMATIC: Read DB and apply HDEV optimization`
  * `4 -- Plot results in bar charts`
  * `0 -- EXIT`
* 1: Extracts pipelines from DB (`linked_list_of_mean_fitness_and_digraph`) and writes digraphs to `param_tuning\digraph_mean\*.txt`
* 2: Reads hdev files from `param_tuning\hdev_manual` and runs LS and SA
  * before running no. 2, all txt-based digraph files have to be manually translated to executable hdev files
  * also, for each hdev file, a python function has to be created to run the parameter tuning
* 3: (_NOT TESTED/FULLY IMPLEMENTED_) Automatically Reads from DB and writes pipelines to hdev (`param_tuning\hdev`)
* 4: Reads LS/SA results from txt files (`param_tuning\hdev_manual\*.txt`) and creates bar charts
### CGP configuration

- ES(1 + 4) recommended as the most efficient configuration, therefore will not be changed
- input and output is usually 1 image
- levels back `l` usually 1, but not as much applicable due to the dependency graph
- termination reached at 150 generations

| Parameter            | Value           |
|----------------------|-----------------|
| ES(&#956; + &#955;)  | ES(1 + 4)       |
| Mutation rate        | -              |
| Termination          | 150 generations |
| `n`<sub>r</sub>      | 10              |
| `n`<sub>c</sub>      | 10              |
| `n`<sub>i</sub>      | 1               |
| `n`<sub>o</sub>      | 1               |
| `l`                  | 1               |
| `n`<sub>f</sub>      | ?               |

## Complexity Analysis

In general, the following formula allows to compute the entropy or information density of an image:

`$- \sum_{i=0}^{n=1} p_{i} log_{b} p_{i}$`

`where n is the number of gray levels (256 for 8-bit images), p_{i} is the probability of a pixel having gray level i, and b is the base of the logarithm function.`
