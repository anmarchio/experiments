| Experiment | Dataset | Problem | Hypothesis | Goal |
| ---------- | ------- | ------- | ---------- | ---- |
| CGP Classic | Carbon Fibres | Object Detection: fitness on bounding boxes | worst results compared to CGP-SSR, CGP with parameter tuning, U-Net | based on settings used for ICMLA 2017 |
| CGP with Parameter Optimisation | Carbon Fibres | Object Detection: fitness on bounding boxes | fitness \textit{significantly} superior to CGP Classic; inferior to CGP-SSR, to U-Net | based on settings from ICMLA 2017 |
| CGP Classic | Carbon Fibres | Semantic Segmentation with free evolution | \textit{significantly} inferior results compared to CGP-SSR, CGP with parameter tuning, U-Net | Reproduce results from traditional approach (e. g. ICMLA 2017), set a reference |
| CGP with Parameter Optimisation | Carbon Fibres | Semantic Segmentation using only parameter mutation | fitness \textit{significantly} superior to CGP Classic; inferior to CGP-SSR, to U-Net | Reproduce results from traditional approach (e. g. ICMLA 2017), set a reference |
